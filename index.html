                    if you plan on going for a quick and easy hike... well it's important that you know some rules about the environment you're going to interface with.

                    <h2>A brief guide</h2>
                <p> The important thing is to always respect the environment. Twigs are easy to set on fire, so be careful with the tools that you use, especially during hot days of summer. <br> 
                    The probability that a fire occurs during periods of intense heat and high temperatures is very high, especially when there are a lots of twigs all over your path. A simple and small fire, 
                    due to the density of the twigs, which are one on top of the other in a very disordered organization, could result in a big fire that could expand over the whole forest.                    

                </p>
                <p>Let's see a comparison between twigs on fire and twigs not on fire:</p>
